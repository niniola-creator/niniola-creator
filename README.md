About Me

Hi, I’m Hannah Niniola. I'm a self-taught data analyst, front-end developer, and geoscientist by training. Yes, I studied geology in school, but I discovered a genuine interest in tech and data along the way. 

My path into tech has been hands-on and curiosity-driven. I’ve taught myself tools like Python, Excel, SQL, and JavaScript, and I’m always looking for practical ways to apply what I learn. These days, I enjoy working with numbers (datasets), creating visually appealing dashboards that reveal the stories behind the numbers and spotting trends which will help make better decisions, alongside building clean and  responsive web interfaces. 

This is a repository to showcase my skills and share progress in my Data Analytics/Data Science journey. You can also find some of the responsive web designs I have created.

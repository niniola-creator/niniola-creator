## About Me

Hi, my name is Hannah. I'm a self-taught data analyst, front-end developer and geoscientist by training. Yes, I studied geology in school and along the way I discovered a genuine interest in tech and data.

My path into tech has been hands-on and curiosity-driven. I’ve taught myself tools like Python, Excel, SQL and JavaScript, and I’m always looking for practical ways to apply what I learn. These days, I enjoy working with numbers (datasets), creating visually appealing dashboards that reveal the stories behind these numbers and spotting trends to help make better decisions. I also love building clean and responsive web interfaces.

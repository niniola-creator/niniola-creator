## About Me

Hi, my name is Hannah. I'm a self-taught data analyst, front-end developer and geoscientist by training. Yes, I studied geology in school and along the way I discovered a genuine interest in tech and data.

My path into tech has been hands-on and curiosity-driven. I’ve taught myself tools like Python, Excel, SQL and JavaScript, and I’m always looking for practical ways to apply what I learn. These days, I enjoy working with numbers (datasets), creating visually appealing dashboards that reveal the stories behind these numbers and spotting trends to help make better decisions. I also love building clean and responsive web interfaces. 


## Projects

### [Air Quality Analysis of Particulate Matter (PM<sub>10</sub>)](https://github.com/niniola-creator/air_quality_analysis)

This project analyzes the air quality in Badagry, Southwest Nigeria, by examining PM₁₀ particles. Using Python and pandas, I performed a geochemical assessment of air samples from market, residential and traffic zones to identify pollution patterns and public health risks. The findings were visualized using matplotlib and seaborn to highlight element concentrations, correlations and location-specific pollution trends.
